Extra requirements
If you want to use this package, you'll need a bot API key. Check the following documentation for more instructions on that.

Getting everything started up
The most difficult thing to do when performing an action with the Telegram API is to get the chat_id, which is the actual conversation window the bot talks to. You can execute the GetUpdates() method in order to get this chatId. Note that there are some caveats on this, so you may be better out with the SetWebhook() method instead.

Development
Semver
I will try my best to respect Semantic Versioning.
That being said, the first stable release is v1.0.0, from there on no mayor BC changes will occur unless we update the major.

Want to colaborate?
Collaborations are very welcome! Check this Wiki page out for more information that will make the development easier!
